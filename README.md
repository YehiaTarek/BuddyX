# BuddyX
Buddy is a chatbot uses the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT which is one of the most heavily researched clinical approaches to treating depression.
Buddy is not a replacement for an in-person therapist, but the app presents itself as an automated therapist when finding a real one can feel like a logistical and financial impossibility. At the same time, the need for therapists is only growing. The app gives the user a full experience through going through sessions that corrects the mindset and helps the user to a more positive mindset and helps him track his mood and progress. And a 24hr AI bot that gives you an immediate answer to help answer any phycological problem
